			<p><h2>Educational Video: Zoom Breakout Rooms</h2>
			<br><br>


			<p>I've taught a number of training classes on Zoom Breakout Rooms and found that one of the biggest challenges was 
				in limiting the video down to two minutes. (My classes are typically an hour long!)

	<br><br>

	- Recorded the audio using Audacity with a Samson C01U USB microphone and shock mount condenser/stand.
	<br><br>
	- I edited the audio in Audacity, removing background noise  from my recording and modifying some of the effects (Amplify and Speed)
	<br><br>
	- Music is Limit 70 by Kevin MacLeod, provided royalty free from Incompetech
	<br><br>
	- I merged the two tracks in Audacity
	<br><br>
	- I ran multiple Zoom meetings and breakout sessions to screen capture the GUI.
	<br><br>
	- I obtained royalty-free and some stock photos from Shutterstock subscription, as well as VecktorStock and WebStockReview.
	<br><br>
	- The images of the faces were provided by thispersondoesnotexist.com (All were AI generated and used with permission by the developer Phillip Wang.
	<br><br>
	- Most of the images were modified using a combination of Mac Preview, GIMP, and PowerPoint.
	<br><br>
	- Video editing occurred on iMovie.
	<br><br>
	- The biggest challenge was trying to sync up the audio with the various screen shots.  I tried to do some timing with the music but it was not truly necessary as the music had a fast beat/rhythm (102.65bpm).  I incorporated multiple transition effects (primarily at the beginning and end) and included the use of a number of Ken Burns effects when needing particular focus on specific shots.  I added multiple text overlays where needed to add additional detail.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, I kept struggling with the results which probably dragged this on. I probably should have reminded myself of the quote:
	<br><br>
	"Done is better than perfect" and "Perfect is the enemy of good"
