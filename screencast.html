                <p>Below is an example of a screencast project from Module 6:Project 7: Screencast.  The specific topic of this video is a <br>
								tutorial on the polling feature within Zoom meetings. Polls are a great way to engage students or meeting participants <br>
								within Zoom meetings. It offers meeting hosts the opportunity to get feedback or answers to questions and can increase <br>
								interaction or participation. Created with Camtasia and posted on YouTube.  Click below the image to view more details.

			<p><h2>Screencast: Zoom Polls</h2>
			<br><br>


			<p>I've taught a number of training classes on Zoom Polls and Reports and found that one of the biggest challenges was
				in limiting the video down to four minutes. (My classes are typically an hour long!)

	<br><br>

	- Recorded the audio using Audacity with a Samson C01U USB microphone and trimount condenser/stand.  Despite that, I noticed that the final edit had some audio noise.
	<br><br>
	- I created multiple Zoom meetings with multiple users to create and take polls.
	<br><br>
	- The video was captured/recorded with Camtasia from TechSmith.
	<br><br>
	- I wrote a script to be recorded.  Unfortunately, this had to be edited/shortened multiple times to bet below four minutes.
	<br><br>
	- Unfortunately, I struggled with the edits as video would constantly lose track after each cut/splice.  It appears that the more times a video is split and cut/pasted, <br>
	the more that the video loses its tracking.
	<br><br>
	- My goal was to show both perspectives from both the meeting host and the participant.  The shots (going back and forth) seemed like it might be a little confusing <br>
	for the viewer of the video so I minimized this.
	<br><br>
	- The final product/project changed the timing.  My goal will be to go back and reproduce this but instead of doing post-recording edits, I will try to record audio with video at the same time.
